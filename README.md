# ENVIRONMENTAL-SOUND-CLASSIFICATION
Environmental sound classification is the preprocessing and the classification of 
the sounds obtained from the everyday environment. It is a crucial method to interpret the 
sound signals and use them in various applications. Our dataset includes a total of 2000
samples labeled under 50 specific types. To overcome this challenge, we tried various machine 
learning and deep learning methods such as  CNN and CRNN. I also tried to augment the amount 
to data to provide more data to our model obtain higher performance from our models.   


I tried to detection ENVIRONMENTAL-SOUND but I didnt take accuracy I wanted. You are free to use my codes :)
